## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
With the rapid expansion of digital infrastructure, cybersecurity threats such as malware, phishing, ransomware, and insider attacks have increased significantly. Organizations and individuals face constant risks from cybercriminals attempting to exploit vulnerabilities in networks, applications, and endpoints.
A Cybersecurity Threat Detection System is essential to proactively monitor, detect, and mitigate potential threats in real time. The system should leverage AI and machine learning to analyze network traffic, user behavior, and system logs to identify anomalies and malicious activities before they cause damage.

## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Defence

## Idea
1. AI-Driven Threat Detection
Use machine learning models to analyze network traffic, system logs, and user behavior to identify anomalies.
Detect zero-day attacks and advanced persistent threats (APTs) by recognizing unusual activity patterns.
Implement signature-based and heuristic analysis for malware detection.

2. Intrusion Detection & Prevention System (IDS/IPS)
Deploy Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) like Snort or Suricata to monitor network traffic for malicious activity.
Implement Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to automatically block threats in real time.

3. Phishing & Malware Detection
Use NLP (Natural Language Processing) to analyze email content and detect phishing attempts.
Implement sandboxing to analyze suspicious attachments or executable files before execution.

4. Real-Time Threat Monitoring & Alert System
Develop a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for real-time log analysis.
Generate risk scores for potential threats and provide security teams with automated alerts.
Use automated response mechanisms to isolate infected devices or block malicious IPs.

5. Behavioral Analytics for Insider Threats
Monitor user activity to detect abnormal login patterns, unusual data transfers, or privilege escalation attempts.
Identify compromised accounts by analyzing deviations in normal user behavior.

6. Real-Time Cyber Threat Intelligence Dashboard
Provide a dashboard with threat analytics, attack trends, and security recommendations.
Use visualization tools (Grafana, Kibana, Power BI) for interactive insights.

## Use Cases
1. Anomaly-Based Intrusion Detection
Actor: IT Security Team
Scenario: The system continuously monitors network traffic and detects unusual patterns, such as a sudden spike in data transfers.
Outcome: The security team is alerted, and automated actions (e.g., blocking the IP) are taken to prevent a potential data breach.

2. Phishing Email Detection
Actor: Employee & AI Detection System
Scenario: An employee receives a suspicious email. The system scans the email content, attachments, and sender details for phishing indicators.
Outcome: If flagged as phishing, the email is quarantined, and the user is notified.

3. Insider Threat Detection
Actor: Employee & Security System
Scenario: An employee attempts to access restricted files outside working hours. The system detects unusual behavior based on past access logs.
Outcome: The system notifies the security team and may temporarily restrict access.

4. Malware Detection & Prevention
Actor: Endpoint Protection System
Scenario: A user downloads a file containing malware. The system runs a sandbox analysis and detects malicious behavior.
Outcome: The system blocks the file from executing and alerts the IT team.

5. DDoS Attack Mitigation
Actor: Web Application Firewall (WAF) & Security Team
Scenario: The system detects an unusually high volume of requests from multiple IP addresses, indicating a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack.
Outcome: The system automatically blocks traffic from suspicious IPs and balances the load to maintain system availability.

6. Real-Time Security Dashboard & Reporting
Actor: IT Security Administrator
Scenario: The security team monitors real-time dashboards showing security threats, active alerts, and mitigation actions.
Outcome: The team can take proactive measures to strengthen defenses based on detected trends.
